# Football-Notebooks



These are a random collection of Football notebooks I've done and liked, scraping from several websites such as [Whoscored](https://www.whoscored.com/), [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) and [Understat](https://understat.com/)

Here a brief resume : 

## After scraping and cleaning data from Whoscored, I have made a passmaps for successful and unsuccessful passes

## Short, medium and long passes :

## Now onto Convex Hulls, as a way of representing the zone where the players were :

## Player actions :

## Percentile Rankings  
And finally inspired by [Baseball Savant percentiles rankings](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/yordan-alvarez-670541?stats=statcast-r-hitting-mlb) , I decided to give it a try with Pedri from FC Barcelona
